# Open Signal 📡

**Broadcast your skills. Find your people. Build with trust.**

Open Signal is a developer-focused **Looking For Group (LFG) platform** built on top of GitHub identity.  
It helps developers broadcast what they **offer**, what they’re **looking for**, and connect safely through a **trust and moderation layer**.

---

## ✨ What It Does
- **Profiles as Signals**  
  - Short 200–300 character summary.  
  - Tags for **Offering** (skills/resources) and **Looking For** (needs/collaborators).  
  - One profile per GitHub account, enforced via GitHub OAuth.

- **Trust & Moderation Layer**  
  - “Effect tags” like *Outstanding Citizen*, *Poison Links*, *Saboteur*.  
  - Quarantine system for flagged profiles.  
  - Transparent, fair, and visible moderation.

- **Visibility & Fairness**  
  - Profiles displayed as cards with consistent layout.  
  - Sorting by freshness, trust, and optional featured status.  
  - No endless feeds — clarity and discoverability first.

---

## 🔐 Authentication
- GitHub OAuth (via NextAuth.js) ensures every action is tied to a verified GitHub account.  
- Enforces **one profile per GitHub ID**.  
- No anonymous spam, no fake accounts.

---

## 💰 Monetization (Future Roadmap)
- **Donations**: GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective.  
- **Premium Visibility**: Featured profiles.  
- **Recruiter Access**: Paid search/filter access.  
- **Bounties/Marketplace**: Optional transaction layer.

---

## 🚀 Vision
Open Signal is not just another job board. It’s:
- A **trust-driven collaboration layer** for developers.  
- A **global map of skills and needs**, powered by GitHub identity.  
- A **community-first platform** where fairness, visibility, and moderation are built in from day one.
